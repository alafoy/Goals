# Goals
Submit any code needed to satisfy the requirements of the specified quarterly goal
Create a new READMe repository for each goal that should be met. Title "GOAL #", where # is the number of goal for which the goal satisfies. Explain within the Readme the code, its purpose, and how it meets the goal.
Upload your code from your preffered IDE underneath the Readme for the corresponding goal

Depending on your specific goals you may have 3 different repositories or no repositories.
